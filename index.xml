      <description>Using R and Python Together! A very handy use of RStudio is that Python can be run in it rather than needing another platform to run python in. To do so, you will need to install the package: reticulate in R. This is what R uses to communicate back and forth with python. Without this package, nothing written in a python code block will run. An example has been included for your benefit below.</description>

      <description>My dataset is about cardiovascular disease and cardiovascular health of various people. In this project I am looking into what affects whether or not a person has cardiovascular disease or whether or not a person is at risk for cardiovascular disease. The data is measuring 12 different aspects of a person; they are listed below.

      <description>This project takes a look at the statistics of police shootings and victims of police brutality. I am putting together two datasets to go over similarities and find general locations and ethnicities in those various locations to understand where police brutality is more common.

# Using R and Python Together!

A very handy use of RStudio is that Python can be run in it rather than needing another platform to run python in. 
To do so, you will need to install the package: reticulate in R. This is what R uses to communicate back and forth with python. Without this package, nothing written in a python code block will run. An example has been included for your benefit below. 

# Reticulate Example



```{R}
library(reticulate)
r_words <- "This was written in an R chunk and it'll be printed out below in the python chunk."
```

As written above, this string will be run using a python chunk even though it was written in an R chunk. Pretty cool stuff!

```{python}
p_words = "Look! The chunk of r code executed with python thanks to reticulate right below this!"

print(p_words)
print(r.r_words)

```

Thanks to reticulate, this will no longer be you :)
